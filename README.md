###Another Starter React Application.


I have created another React Starter applicaion for my own use.

This application implements a build system as well as a few basic components and a component messaging system.

[http://react.goatstone.biz](http://react.goatstone.biz)

The Components:

A main Menu that can be shown and hidden.

A component to display messages to the user.

A component that resembles a music player with symbols for 
play, stop, fast forward and reverse.

A component that displays a list of items.

A series of CSS animations : 
   spinner, bouncer, slow flasher, glower, color shifter, ufoer, clouder 

I am using code from this starter application:
